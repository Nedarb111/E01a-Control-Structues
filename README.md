With this code I've established a more enriched understanding of basic code. At the end of this, i was actually able to understand the purpose of each bit of code and I was able to type out everything to my best ablility. I didn't really go in understanding what any of it was about, but when i came out I was suprised I had the ability to complete the extra credit- I didn't think I'd be able to do it :) I'm happy I did!! 

p.s sorry for any mispellings
